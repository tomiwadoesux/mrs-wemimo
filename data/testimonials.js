      "Hmm! it's beyond what I could ever think of: a vibrant person, full of life, always joyful and calm, dying on her Jesus Day- Christmas morning. It weakens me. I am not used to writing this kind of thing, but for her full participation in our Sunday School class, I owe the obligation of saying a few words about her. She is thoughtful, very deep Christian wise, she has a very deep Christian foundation. She contributed well during our Sunday School class, she shared testimonies of her Christian experiences which in most cases, encouraging to some of us. She loves her families, the children and she's equally humble. I will encourage my brother, Oyawe, to take solace in the fact that God needs her to join the Heaven Triumphants Choirs and she has gone to be with her God and Creator. The Lord will be with you, comfort you always, and when you are alone, thinking of her, the angels of Heaven will surround you to give you happiness and strength to continue the journey. To the children, you are not motherless, you have a heritage of good.mother and this will give you space in this life. To the Fadeyis and Oludipes, words are not enough to comfort you of this great loss, but the fact that you all know Christ, the Lord will give you the succor to continue the race. To our Church, AEBC, we are more than conquerors through Christ who empowers us. Dear Sister, Wumi Oyawe, Good Night.",

Your spirit will continue to illuminate the lives of all of us at AEBC.  You lived a life that was, in every facet, a masterpiece of grace, elegance, and boundless generosity.  I will always remember the warmth of your smile, the wisdom in your words especially when you talked about your visits to Nigeria, and the beauty you brought to every room you entered.  Forever in our hearts, till we meet again. ♥️ Abiola & John Adeniji",

Thank you for being you. Thank you for singing with the angels in heaven and praying for us.
